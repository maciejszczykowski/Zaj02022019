            of your CV and make it look like a letterhead:

            can easily be reached and are willing to give you a good reference.

            Your personal profile should include additional information about your age, status, interests and other relevant information
            that can produce a positive picture of your character. I will suggest you put this in the last paragraph of your
            CV.

        <p>
            Employers will be interested in this paragraph because it reveals your character, but be careful. Don't overdo the description
            of your interest and don't describe interests that might distract your job. If you are coaching a football team,
            don't count the number of wins. Let them ask you about details in a later interview if they are interested.
